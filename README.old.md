## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on
how to deploy the project on a live system (**if it applies to this
project/pill**).

### The repository

First, you will need to `clone` or `fork` the repository into your Github
account:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/assembler-school/node-develop-your-mvc-project.git
```

## Deployment

For this project you can use Netlify to deploy the front app.

## Technologies used

- React.js

## Project requirements

- You must use semantic HTML5 elements for all the contents of the application
- All code including comments need to be written in English
- Use a code style like camelCase
- It is recommended to divide the tasks into several subtasks so that you can
  associate each particular step of the construction with a specific commitment
- You should try as much as possible that the commits and planned tasks are the
  same
- You must create a correctly documented README.md file in the root directory of
  the project (see guidelines in Resources)
- All the routes that are specified as protected should be protected so that
  only users that are logged in and have the appropriate ROLE (ADMIN | EMPLOYEE)
  can perform operations and access data or endpoints
- You must store any sensitive data in .env variables and ignore the file from
  the git repository history
